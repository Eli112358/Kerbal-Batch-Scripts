# Kerbal-Batch-Scripts
Some useful Batch scripts for Kerbal Space Program (WIP)

## Progress
KspDataCli.cmd can only load and display data; modify and save are planned future features.
KspProfiles.cmd sets up the necessary folders and variables on first run

## Setting up
Extract all scripts to a folder and run the `KspProfiles.cmd` script as admin.


## Requirements
The `KspDataCli` script requires java runtime environment.

## Note
When you want to play without mods, just do `KspProfiles activate Vanilla`. Always use an elevated command prompt for `KspProfiles.cmd`, otherwise it won't work.
